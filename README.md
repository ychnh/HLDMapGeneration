# HLDMapGeneration
Hyper Light Drifter Modding

# Installation Guide
1. https://github.com/ychnh/HLDMapGeneration/blob/master/docs/Windows_Install_Guide/install.md

# Notes
A new level is generated everytime you leave the map.
 Because I am not deallocating resources after they die, the game will get a bit laggy after 5-8 regeneration of the map. (On my crappy computer at least)
 Just restart the hyper light drifter game and it should be fine.

The game gets more difficult the more you play. If the game is getting too difficult, restart the python script. The difficulty will reset.

# Future
* UI Custom overlay
* https://github.com/dzen/pyosd
* Move to different planets after exiting game and starting new
* Generate planets randomly with GANs
